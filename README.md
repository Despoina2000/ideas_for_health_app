## Initial R&D Tasks (parallel for 2 members)
- [ ] **Tasks Management & Review of the code**: review existing boards like kanban or azure devops for github where we can put status to our tasks like (Ready to Start, Active, Paused etc).
- [x] **Market Research**: review existing medical data apps to analyze UX, UI patterns, and feature sets.
- [x] **UI Library Research**: evaluate Angular UI libraries that provide a file uploader out-of-the-box with drag-drop and custom handling.
- [ ] **Authentication / Security Research**: evaluate libraries or approaches for local authentication, encryption, and passkey protection.
